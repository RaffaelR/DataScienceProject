notebook.ipynb contains the code for a classification analysis with machine learning methods.
First we extract, load and transform the data perfroming data and cleaning analysis.
The we use two methodsto classify the data, Logsitic Regression and Gradient Boosting. We also perform GridCV optimziation on the parameters of the Gradient Boosting for better performance.
The jupyter notebook has comments trhoughout the code to help the user.
